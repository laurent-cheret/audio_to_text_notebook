        "\n",
        "1. RUN THE CODE\n",
        "   - (Detail: If you are able to select another environment with GPU instead of the standard CPU, this code will run significantly faster).\n",
        "   - Click the Play button (▶) on the left side of this code box\n",
        "   - OR press Shift + Enter on your keyboard\n",
        "   - Wait while it installs (you'll see text appearing below)\n",
        "\n",
        "2. UPLOAD YOUR AUDIO FILE\n",
        "   - A \"Choose Files\" button will appear\n",
        "   - Click it and select your M4A (or MP3, WAV) audio file\n",
        "   - Wait for it to upload (you'll see a progress bar)\n",
        "\n",
        "3. WAIT FOR TRANSCRIPTION\n",
        "   - The code will automatically transcribe your audio\n",
        "   - When done, your transcription will appear below\n",
        "   - A text file will automatically download to your computer\n",
        "\n",
        "THAT'S IT! No account needed, completely free.\n",
        "\n",
        "TIPS:\n",
        "- Longer audio files take more time (be patient!)\n",
        "- For better accuracy: Change \"base\" to \"small\" or \"medium\" below\n",
        "- For faster results: Change \"base\" to \"tiny\" below\n",
        "- You can transcribe multiple files - just run the code again\n",
