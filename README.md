## ⚙️ Model Options

The notebook uses the "base" model by default. You can change it for different results:

- **tiny** - Fastest, less accurate

- **small** - More accurate, slower
- **medium** - Very accurate, takes longer
- **large** - Most accurate, slowest

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**Problem:** "Runtime disconnected"  
**Solution:** Google Colab has usage limits. Wait a bit and try again, or restart the runtime.

**Problem:** File upload fails  
**Solution:** Check your internet connection. Very large files (>500MB) may have issues.

**Problem:** Transcription is inaccurate  
**Solution:** Try using a larger model like "small" or "medium" for better accuracy.
